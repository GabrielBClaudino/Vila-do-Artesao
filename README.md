# This website was created as part of an integrative project at UNIFACISA. It aims to showcase the artisans and their products from VILA DO ARTES√ÉO-CG. The project leverages a combination of web development technologies to deliver a comprehensive and interactive user experience:

## * HTML (HyperText Markup Language): Used to structure the content of the website. HTML provides the foundation for web pages, allowing the organization of text, images, and multimedia content to present the artisans and their products in a structured and accessible way.

## * CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Applied for styling the website. CSS enhances the visual appeal of the site by defining the layout, colors, fonts, and overall design, creating a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing look and feel that reflects the artistic nature of the ar#tisan community.

## * JavaScript: Employed to add interactivity and dynamic elements to the website. JavaScript allows for features such as interactive galleries, responsive menus, and real-time data updates, ensuring a seamless and engaging experience for users as they explore the various artisan products and profiles.

## * Python: Utilized to create a form that allows editing the JSON data of our site. This enables the dynamic updating of artisan information and product listings, providing a straightforward and efficient way to manage content directly from the website without needing to manually edit the JSON files.
